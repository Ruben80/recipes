# **Creamy Spiced Black Bean Quesadilla**

_Creamy spicy, crispy and oh so delicious! These are low in fat, oil free and only take 10-15 mins to make - they make a wonderful dinner or healthy snack. Although tamari is not technically a Mexican condiment Dave jokingly said when he was last in Mexico he found a bottle in an asian store! It does give more flavour and saves time so worth using if you can._
